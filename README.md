# SpaceNetwork
CS290B Java-Cluster Course Project

Space network system is the scale up of Space-Computer model. In our design, the system has the following two hierarchies.
Universe - Space
Space - Computer
The Universe manages Spaces in a similar way as the Space manages Computers. By implementing coarse and fine Tasks achieve work balance among Spaces. And by implementing checkpoint at Universe and Task Tracking at Space, we achieve fault-tolerance.
